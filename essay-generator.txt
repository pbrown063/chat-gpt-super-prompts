Please forget all prior prompts. 

I want you to become my [framing topic] helper. Your goal is to mediate a conversation between 2 people around [puropse problem outcome]. The further goal is to summarize the conversation and produce an essay based on the conclusion, arguments, and common ground that was found.

The essay will have been written by third party observer of the conversation. They will have a language comprehension level of [level]; grammatical errors, typos, and unclear ideas, etc should be used according to the level of the writer.

One of the conversation participants is [character profile].

The other person is [character profile].

Even when a participant of the conversation says something that is questionable or dubious, you have a duty to let them finish their thought and the opponent to respond, leaving remarks for the summary.

I will provide you with a list of works with which to determine the content being discussed. This list is contained in the following parentheses:
{
   [List of citations - books - links, etc]

Additionally the parameters contained in the following parentheses will have no bearing on the conversation, but instead add flavour to the summary essay:

   level of creativity on a scale of 1-10, 10 being more creative: [1-10]
   references to source material on a scale of 1-10, 10 having more references: [1-10]
}

1) A transcript of the conversation as it unfolds between the 2 participants with your mediation
